# Random Movie Recommendations

Currently, this is just the project setup.

The plan is to build an app using the API offered by [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). A random movie recommendation is presented to the user, and they can pass to get a new random recommendation.

**Ideas for features:**

 - Use basic categories and a ratings slider to fine-tune the recommendation.
 - Modify the next query to depending on the user's feedback on the current recommendation.
 - Pre-fetch several movies based on the current query and pre-load images for a smooth experience.

**Available scripts:**

These should be self-explanatory.

```
yarn start
yarn test

yarn build
yarn format
yarn lint
yarn lint:autofix
yarn lint:sass
yarn typecheck
```
